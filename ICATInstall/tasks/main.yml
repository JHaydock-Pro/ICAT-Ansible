#Master file for ICATInstall

#---NOTES---
#Variables are currently stored in a single YAML file, these should be separated by OS (eg. Ubuntu, Debian etc) or by function (eg. logins, package versions etc)

#---TODO---
# Check which plays need separate install for other OSs
# Organise variables for easy customisation
# Improve non-fresh install checking to skip tasks rather than ignoring errors (see mysql.yml and storage.yml)
# Improve feedback
# Add autotests
